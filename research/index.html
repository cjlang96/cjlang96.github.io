solution greatly simplifies these non-linear constraints. This
simplification not only allows us to easily find a plethora of novel
instantons with various continuous conformal symmetries and higher rank
structure groups, it also provides a framework for classifying such
symmetric objects. We also prove that the basic instanton is essentially
the only instanton with two particular kinds of conformal symmetry.
Additionally, we discuss the connections between instantons with
continuous symmetries and other gauge-theoretic objects: hyperbolic and
singular monopoles as well as hyperbolic analogues to Higgs bundles and
Nahm data.</p></details><h3 id=hyperbolic-monopoles-with-continuous-symmetries-j.-geom.-phys.-203-105258-2024.-doi-arxiv-main-results>“Hyperbolic

lead to anisotropy over a wide range of length scales, which is
characterized by layerwise pancake vortices, thin regions of strong
shear, and patches of small-scale turbulence. It has long been known
that stratified turbulence becomes increasingly isotropic as one moves
to smaller length scales, as the eddy timescale decreases towards and
below the buoyancy period. This paper investigates the anisotropy of
stratified turbulence across scales and the transition towards isotropy
at small scales, using a variety of techniques. Direct numerical
simulations of strongly stratified turbulence, with buoyancy Reynolds
numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Re}_b\)</span> up to 50, are
analyzed. We examine the relative contributions of different components
of the strain rate tensor to the kinetic energy dissipation, the
invariants of the isotropy tensor, directional kinetic energy spectra,
and the subfilter energy flux across different length scales. At small
scales, the degree of isotropy is determined by <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Re}_b\)</span>, while at the Ozmidov and
larger scales, the anisotropy also depends on the Froude number. The
change in the anisotropy with scale and with the parameters is examined
in detail. Interestingly, Ozmidov-scale eddies are found to become
increasingly isotropic as <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Re}_b\)</span> increases, as characterized
by the isotropy tensor invariants and the subfilter energy flux. At
larger scales, the energy spectra for near-vertical wave vectors have a
spectral slope around <span class="math inline">\(−3\)</span>, which
shallow towards <span class="math inline">\(−1\)</span> for
near-horizontal wave vectors. These spectra converge beyond the Ozmidov
scale, increasingly so for large <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Re}_b\)</span>. These results suggest that
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Re}_b\gtrsim 500\)</span> would be
necessary to obtain the same degree of small-scale isotropy that is
found in similarly sized simulations of unstratified turbulence.</p></details><h2 id=submitted-papers>Submitted Papers</h2><h3 id=fixed-points-of-lie-group-actions-on-moduli-spaces-a-tale-of-two-actions-2024.-arxiv-main-results>“Fixed

themselves built as quotients by group actions) and their fixed points.
We show that when the Lie group is compact and connected, we obtain a
linear constraint. This constraint makes the problem of finding fixed
points one of representation theory, greatly simplifying the search for
such points. We obtain a similar result when the Lie group is
one-dimensional. For compact and disconnected Lie groups, we show that
we need only additionally check a finite number of points. Finally, we
show that the subgroup fixing an equivalence class in the moduli space
is a compact Lie subgroup.</p></details><h2 id=ph.d.-thesis>Ph.D. Thesis</h2><h3 id=solitons-with-continuous-symmetries-2024.-uwspace-fixed-points-on-moduli-spaces-symmetric-euclidean-monopoles-symmetric-hyperbolic-monopoles-symmetric-instantons-symmetry-breaking-of-monopoles-representation-theory-notes-gmom-2024-talk>“Solitons

various symmetric solitons: instantons as well as hyperbolic, singular,
and Euclidean monopoles. Examples of these objects are hard to come by
