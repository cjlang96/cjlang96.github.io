the construction of all those with spherically symmetry. In doing so, we
reduce the problem of finding spherically symmetric hyperbolic monopoles
to a problem in representation theory. Additionally, we determine
constraints on the structure groups of such monopoles. Using these

lead to anisotropy over a wide range of length scales, which is
characterized by layerwise pancake vortices, thin regions of strong
shear, and patches of small-scale turbulence. It has long been known
that stratified turbulence becomes increasingly isotropic as one moves
to smaller length scales, as the eddy timescale decreases towards and
below the buoyancy period. This paper investigates the anisotropy of
stratified turbulence across scales and the transition towards isotropy
at small scales, using a variety of techniques. Direct numerical
simulations of strongly stratified turbulence, with buoyancy Reynolds
numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Re}_b\)</span> up to 50, are
analyzed. We examine the relative contributions of different components
of the strain rate tensor to the kinetic energy dissipation, the
invariants of the isotropy tensor, directional kinetic energy spectra,
and the subfilter energy flux across different length scales. At small
scales, the degree of isotropy is determined by <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Re}_b\)</span>, while at the Ozmidov and
larger scales, the anisotropy also depends on the Froude number. The
change in the anisotropy with scale and with the parameters is examined
in detail. Interestingly, Ozmidov-scale eddies are found to become
increasingly isotropic as <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Re}_b\)</span> increases, as characterized
by the isotropy tensor invariants and the subfilter energy flux. At
larger scales, the energy spectra for near-vertical wave vectors have a
spectral slope around <span class="math inline">\(−3\)</span>, which
shallow towards <span class="math inline">\(−1\)</span> for
near-horizontal wave vectors. These spectra converge beyond the Ozmidov
scale, increasingly so for large <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Re}_b\)</span>. These results suggest that
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Re}_b\gtrsim 500\)</span> would be
necessary to obtain the same degree of small-scale isotropy that is
found in similarly sized simulations of unstratified turbulence.</p><h2 id=ph.d.-thesis>Ph.D. Thesis</h2><h3 id=solitons-with-continuous-symmetries-2024.-uwspace-fixed-points-on-moduli-spaces-symmetric-instantons-symmetry-breaking-of-monopoles-representation-theory-notes-gmom-2024-talk>“Solitons

talk</a></h3><h4 id=abstract-3>Abstract</h4><p>In this thesis, we develop a framework for classifying symmetric
points on moduli spaces using representation theory. We utilize this
framework in a few case studies, but it has applications well beyond
these cases.</p><p>As a demonstration of the power of this framework, we use it to study
various symmetric solitons: instantons as well as hyperbolic, singular,
and Euclidean monopoles. Examples of these objects are hard to come by
due to non-linear constraints. However, by applying this framework, we
introduce a linear constraint, whose solution greatly simplifies the
non-linear constraints. This simplification not only allows us to easily
find a plethora of novel examples of these solitons, it also provides a
framework for classifying such symmetric objects. As an example, by
applying this method, we prove that the basic instanton is essentially
the only instanton with two particular kinds of conformal symmetry.</p><p>Additionally, we study the symmetry breaking of monopoles, a part of
their topological classification. We prove a straightforward method for
determining the symmetry breaking of a monopole and explicitly identify
the symmetry breaking for all Lie groups with classical, simply Lie
algebras. We also identify methods for doing the same for the
exceptional simple Lie groups.</p></div><footer><hr><div class="flex content-center pt-1 px-2"><div class="my-auto text-sm md:text-base"><h5 class=font-semibold>Christopher Lang</h5><a href=mailto:cjlang@uwaterloo.ca>cjlang@uwaterloo.ca</a></div></div></footer></main></body></html>
