points of Lie group actions on moduli spaces: A tale of two actions”.
Theorem 1.1 originally appeared in my <a href=https://hdl.handle.net/10012/20906>thesis</a> as Theorem 1.1.1. I
discussed this result during my talk at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5dZKpBPkxQ&">Geometric Models
of Matter Conference</a> in 2024.</p><p>The results in this paper allow us to study <a href=/ancillaries/euclidmono/>Euclidean monopoles</a>, <a href=/ancillaries/hypermono/>hyperbolic monopoles</a>, and <a href=/ancillaries/instantons/>instantons</a> with continuous
symmetries. However, it is a general result that can also be used
outside of gauge theory to easily find fixed points of Lie group actions
on moduli spaces. These applications comprise the majority of my <a href=https://hdl.handle.net/10012/20906>thesis</a>.</p><h1 id=summary>Summary</h1><p>We examine Lie group actions on moduli spaces and their fixed points.
We show that when the Lie group is compact and connected, we obtain a
linear constraint and the problem is one of representation theory. This
greatly simplifies the search for fixed points. We obtain a similar
result when the Lie group is one-dimensional. For compact and
disconnected Lie groups, we show that we need only additionally check a
finite number of points. Finally, we show that the subgroup fixing an
equivalence class in the moduli space is a compact Lie subgroup.</p><h1 id=introduction>Introduction</h1><p>Gauge theory involves two ingredients: objects and a gauge group
acting on the objects. Physically, we only care about objects up to the
gauge action. Denoting the space of objects by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> and the gauge group by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G},\)</span> we only care about the
moduli space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{G}.\)</span> For instance, in
electromagnetism, the objects of study are one-forms <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> representing the electromagnetic
potential. We are only interested in the electric and magnetic fields
generated by <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: the components of
the curvature two-form <span class="math inline">\(F_A=dA+A\wedge
A.\)</span> The space of one-forms is acted on by the group of smooth
maps <span class="math inline">\(g\colon \mathbb{R}^4\rightarrow
\mathrm{U}(1)\)</span> via <span class="math inline">\(g.A:=gAg^{-1}-(dg)g^{-1}.\)</span> As these smooth
maps are <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{U}(1)\)</span>-valued, we
see that <span class="math inline">\(F_{g.A}=F_A.\)</span> As such,
physically, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g.A\)</span> are equivalent.</p><p>Gauge theoretic objects are difficult to find, they often involve
solving non-linear constraints. We want to use symmetry to find
examples. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> be a
group of symmetries acting on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span>. Generally, when discussing
symmetry, we mean points fixed by an action. However, looking for points
on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> fixed by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is too restrictive. Indeed,
physically, two objects in the same gauge equivalence class are
identical. As such, we want them to have the same symmetry, so we
require the symmetry and gauge actions to commute. This means that the
symmetry action descends to an action on the moduli space.</p><p>We are interested in fixed points on the moduli space. If <span class="math inline">\(A\in\mathcal{X}\)</span> is such that <span class="math inline">\([A]\)</span> is fixed by the symmetry action, then
for all <span class="math inline">\(s\in \mathcal{S},\)</span> there is
some <span class="math inline">\(g\in\mathcal{G}\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(s.A=g.A.\)</span> That is, physically, the
object is unaffected by the symmetry action.</p><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a smooth manifold and
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> a Lie group acting smoothly on
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. The smoothness of the Lie group
actions grants Lie algebra actions. If we have a right (left) group
action, we obtain a Lie algebra (anti-)homomorphism taking value in
<span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M).\)</span> Given <span class="math inline">\(x\in\mathrm{Lie}(G)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\in M,\)</span> the Lie algebra action is given
by <span class="math inline">\(x.p:=\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t=0}\mathrm{exp}(tx).p\in
T_pM.\)</span></p><h2 id=theorem-1.1>Theorem 1.1</h2><p><em>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> be a smooth
manifold, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> a compact Lie
group, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> a compact,
connected Lie group. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> act smoothly on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> on the left and the two
actions commute. We have that <span class="math inline">\([A]\in\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{G}\)</span> is fixed by
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> if and only if there is
a Lie algebra homomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\rho\colon\mathrm{Lie}(\mathcal{S})\rightarrow\mathrm{Lie}(\mathcal{G})\)</span>
such that, for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in\mathrm{Lie}(\mathcal{S}),\)</span> <span class="math display">\[x.A+\rho(x).A=0.\]</span></em></p><p>This result tells us that if we satisfy the proper technical
conditions, then we can differentiate the equations of symmetry,
obtaining linear equations. Thus, we can use linear algebra to find
every example of our symmetric objects. As compact Lie groups can be
realized as matrix Lie groups, the Lie algebra homomorphisms give us
representations of Lie algebras, so we reduce the problem to the realm
of representation theory.</p><p>When <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is
one-dimensional, using a similar method, we obtain the same result even
when we no longer have compactness.</p><h2 id=proposition-1.2>Proposition 1.2</h2><p><em>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> be a smooth
manifold, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> a Lie group,
and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> a connected,
one-dimensional Lie group (isomorphic to either <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>). Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> act smoothly on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> on the left and the two
actions commute. We have that <span class="math inline">\([A]\in\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{G}\)</span> is fixed by
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> if and only if there is
some <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in\mathrm{Lie}(\mathcal{G})\)</span> such
that, for all <span class="math inline">\(t\in\mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[t.A+t\rho.A=0.\]</span></em></p><p>Note that in both of the above results, the two terms in the
equations belong to <span class="math inline">\(T_A\mathcal{X}\)</span>
and thus can be added together to obtain zero. Nothing changes in these
equations if we have two right group actions. However, if we have a mix
of left and right group actions, then the equations become <span class="math inline">\(x.A-\rho(x).A=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t.A-t\rho.A=0\)</span>, respectively.</p><p>Now we consider the case where we do not have connectedness.</p><h2 id=proposition-2.1>Proposition 2.1</h2><p><em>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> be a smooth
manifold and let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> as
well as <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> be Lie groups.
Denote the connected component of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> containing the identity by
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}_0\subseteq\mathcal{S}\)</span>.
Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> act smoothly on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> and the two actions commute.
We have that <span class="math inline">\([A]\in\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{G}\)</span> is fixed by
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\([A]\)</span> is fixed by some element in each
connected component of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\([A]\)</span> is fixed by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}_0\)</span>.</em></p><p>If the symmetry group <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is compact, then it has a
finite number of connected components. As such, if <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is compact, then we need only
check that a point is fixed by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}_0\)</span> and a finite number of
additional points. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}_0\)</span> is a compact and connected
Lie group, falling under the umbrella of Theorem 1.1.</p><p>Armed with Theorem 1.1, we can examine objects that are fixed by
different symmetries. It turns out that we can ignore certain
symmetries, as we can investigate their closure instead.</p><h2 id=proposition-2.4>Proposition 2.4</h2><p><em>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> be a smooth
manifold and let both <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> be Lie groups.
Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> act on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> and their actions commute.
Additionally, suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> acts on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> properly. For <span class="math inline">\(A\in\mathcal{X}\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(H_A:=\{s\in \mathcal{S}\mid s\cdot
[A]=[A]\}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span> is a
closed Lie subgroup of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>.
Moreover, if <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is
compact, then <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span> is as
well.</em></p><p>As an example of the importance of Proposition 2.4, suppose we look
at objects symmetric under different connected Lie subgroups of <span class="math inline">\(S^1\times S^1\)</span>. Excluding the trivial
subgroup, we must consider the Lie subgroups <span class="math inline">\(R_t:=\{(e^{i\theta},e^{it\theta})\mid
\theta\in\mathbb{R}\}\)</span>, for all <span class="math inline">\(t\in\mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R_\infty:=\{1\}\times S^1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(S^1\times S^1\)</span>.</p><p>When <span class="math inline">\(t\in\mathbb{Q}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R_t\simeq S^1\)</span>. Otherwise, <span class="math inline">\(R_t\simeq \mathbb{R}\)</span>, which is a problem
as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is not compact.
Proposition 1.2 allows us to study objects symmetric under <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span>, for any <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is one-dimensional. However,
Proposition 2.4 tells us that, in our case, we can ignore those
symmetries that are not compact. Indeed, when <span class="math inline">\(t\notin\mathbb{Q}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> is dense in <span class="math inline">\(S^1\times S^1\)</span>, so an element in the
moduli space is fixed by <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> if and
only if it is fixed by <span class="math inline">\(S^1\times
S^1\)</span>. Thus, we are only left with compact and connected Lie
groups for symmetry groups, exactly those we can study using Theorem
1.1.</p></div><footer><hr><div class="flex content-center pt-1 px-2"><div class="my-auto text-sm md:text-base"><h5 class=font-semibold>Christopher Lang</h5><a href=mailto:cjlang@uwaterloo.ca>cjlang@uwaterloo.ca</a></div></div></footer></main></body></html>
