1.1: “General background and main theorem”. In particular, this result
allows us to study <a href=/ancillaries/euclidmono/>Euclidean
monopoles</a>, <a href=/ancillaries/hypermono/>hyperbolic
monopoles</a>, and <a href=/ancillaries/instantons/>instantons</a>
with continuous symmetries. These applications comprise the majority of
my <a href=https://hdl.handle.net/10012/20906>thesis</a>. I discussed
this result during my talk at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5dZKpBPkxQ&">Geometric Models
of Matter Conference</a> in 2024.</p><h1 id=summary>Summary</h1><p>We study invariant objects, whose equivalence class in the moduli
space is fixed under the action of a symmetry group. In particular, for
any continuous symmetry, we obtain a linear equation that determines if
a gauge theoretic object possesses that symmetry. Not only does this
result allow us to easily compute examples of these objects, it also
provides a framework for classifying them.</p><h1 id=introduction>Introduction</h1><p>Gauge theory involves two ingredients: objects and a gauge group
acting on the objects. Physically, we only care about objects up to the
gauge action. Denoting the space of objects by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> and the gauge group by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G},\)</span> we only care about the
moduli space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{G}.\)</span> For instance, in
electromagnetism, the objects of study are one-forms <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> representing the electromagnetic
potential. We are only interested in the electric and magnetic fields
generated by <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: the components of
the curvature two-form <span class="math inline">\(F_A=dA+A\wedge
A.\)</span> The space of one-forms is acted on by the group of smooth
maps <span class="math inline">\(g\colon \mathbb{R}^4\rightarrow
\mathrm{U}(1)\)</span> via <span class="math inline">\(g.A:=gAg^{-1}-(dg)g^{-1}.\)</span> As these smooth
maps are <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{U}(1)\)</span>-valued, we
see that <span class="math inline">\(F_{g.A}=F_A.\)</span> As such,
physically, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g.A\)</span> are equivalent.</p><p>Gauge theoretic objects are difficult to find, they often involve
solving non-linear constraints. We want to use symmetry to find
examples. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> be a
group of symmetries acting on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span>. Generally, when discussing
symmetry, we mean points fixed by an action. However, looking for points
on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> fixed by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is too restrictive. Indeed,
physically, two objects in the same gauge equivalence class are
identical. As such, we want them to have the same symmetry, so we
require the symmetry and gauge actions to commute. This means that the
symmetry action descends to an action on the moduli space.</p><p>We are interested in fixed points on the moduli space. If <span class="math inline">\(A\in\mathcal{X}\)</span> is such that <span class="math inline">\([A]\)</span> is fixed by the symmetry action, then
for all <span class="math inline">\(s\in \mathcal{S},\)</span> there is
some <span class="math inline">\(g\in\mathcal{G}\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(s.A=g.A.\)</span> That is, physically, the
object is unaffected by the symmetry action.</p><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a smooth manifold and
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> a Lie group acting smoothly on
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. The smoothness of the Lie group
actions grants Lie algebra actions. If we have a right (left) group
action, we obtain a Lie algebra (anti-)homomorphism taking value in
<span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M).\)</span> Given <span class="math inline">\(x\in\mathrm{Lie}(G)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\in M,\)</span> the Lie algebra action is given
by <span class="math inline">\(x.p:=\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t=0}\mathrm{exp}(tx).p\in
T_pM.\)</span></p><h2 id=theorem-1.1.1>Theorem 1.1.1</h2><p><em>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> be a smooth
manifold, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> a compact Lie
group, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> a compact,
connected Lie group. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> act smoothly on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> on the left and the two
actions commute. We have that <span class="math inline">\([A]\in\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{G}\)</span> is fixed by
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> if and only if there is
a Lie algebra homomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\rho\colon\mathrm{Lie}(\mathcal{S})\rightarrow\mathrm{Lie}(\mathcal{G})\)</span>
such that, for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in\mathrm{Lie}(\mathcal{S}),\)</span> <span class="math display">\[x.A+\rho(x).A=0.\]</span></em></p><p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(x.A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho(x).A\)</span> both belong to <span class="math inline">\(T_A\mathcal{X}\)</span> and thus can be added
together to obtain zero. Similar results to the above hold if we use
right group actions or a mixture.</p><p>This result tells us that if we satisfy the proper technical
conditions, then we can differentiate the equations of symmetry,
obtaining linear equations. Thus, we can use linear algebra to find
every example of our symmetric objects. As compact Lie groups can be
realized as matrix Lie groups, the Lie algebra homomorphisms give us
representations of Lie algebras, so we reduce the problem to the realm
of representation theory.</p></div><footer><hr><div class="flex content-center pt-1 px-2"><div class="my-auto text-sm md:text-base"><h5 class=font-semibold>Christopher Lang</h5><a href=mailto:cjlang@uwaterloo.ca>cjlang@uwaterloo.ca</a></div></div></footer></main></body></html>
