identities of associative algebras</strong><br>The category of algebras with polynomial identities, or PI-algebras,
contains both the category of commutative algebras and of finite
dimensional algebras. Moreover, several classical problems found a
natural solution in this setting. This observation is the key idea that
guided the development of the theory of polynomial identities in the
last century. In recent years, a fruitful approach has been the
description of numerical invariants of the ideal of identities of a
PI-algebra, shedding light on the structure of the algebra itself. The
goal of this introductory talk is to give an overview of the fundamental
result of PI-theory, providing the motivation to the study of polynomial
identities.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>December 2nd</strong></td><td style=text-align:left><strong>Graham Cox - Geometry of
infinite-dimensional manifolds (part 3)</strong><br>This is an introductory talk on differential geometry in infinite
dimensions. I will try to keep prerequisites to a minimum, just assuming
familiarity with basic concepts from differential geometry and
functional analysis (in particular, Banach spaces and finite-dimensional
smooth manifolds).<br><br>Many of the definitions and constructions are identical to those in
finite dimensions, so I will instead focus on some of the subtleties and
differences that arise in infinite dimensions. In a future talk I will
describe some classical examples of this theory, such as manifolds of
mappings and their application to incompressible fluid flow.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>November 25th</strong></td><td style=text-align:left><strong>Serhii Koval - Algebra of
symplectic reduction (part 2)</strong><br>In classical mechanics, symplectic (or Hamiltonian) reduction allows
simplifying the equations of motion by considering symmetries of the
phase space and its furter foliation into symplectic leaves. In this
talk, I will give an introduction to the process of symplectic reduction
from an algebraic perspective in the framework of affine schemes and
actions of reductive groups. I will give an example of computation of
Hamiltonian reduction for the commuting scheme. Time permitting, I will
discuss Hamiltonian reduction along coadjoint orbit and give the
construction of Calogero-Moser space of Kazhdan, Kostant and Sternberg.
This talk is based on the lecture notes of P. Etingof on Calogero-Moser
systems. Reference: <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606233>arXiv:0606233</a>.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>November 18th</strong></td><td style=text-align:left><strong>Graham Cox - Geometry of

Cohomological Field Theories (part 2)</strong><br>Having introduced moduli spaces of curves and Gromov-Witten theory last
week, this week I will present the abstract definition of a
cohomological field theory, explore some of its properties, and describe
the Givental-Teleman classification of semisimple cohomological field
theories. Reference: <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02528>arXiv:1712.02528</a>.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>October 28th</strong></td><td style=text-align:left><strong>Christopher Lang - An introduction
to topological recursion (part 2)</strong><br>Topological recursion is a construction in algebraic geometry that
recursively computes invariants of spectral curves. In this talk, I will
(finally) introduce topological recursion, examine the connection
between topological recursion and Airy ideals, and explore some
applications of this construction. Reference: <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06657>arXiv:2409.06657</a>.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>October 21th</strong></td><td style=text-align:left><strong>Serhii Koval - Algebra of

field theories in the sense of Kontsevich and Manin. Along the way, we
will learn about moduli spaces of complex curves, Gromov-Witten theory,
and 2D topological field theories. I hope to make my presentation
